This contains much uncompleted, or at least unpublished, work.
For work which is incomplete I endeavor to write readme.md files, where I will describe the project and the kind of help or collaboration I would enjoy to have.
You may always e-mail me at davidollodart@gmail.com. Please use whatever results you find here I only ask that you cite me!

As of 2024-07-07, there are no readme.md files, but I will make a directory structure with them mimicking that at the download link here:
