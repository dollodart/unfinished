This article was written in the timeframe of 2015-2016, and I write this in
2024. Less than 2 years after I published this letter a news article on
expanding the UW CS program to double in size with a 5 million dollar
philanthropic gift was published by the UW (See UW news release from
2017/02/16: New UW Computer Science Engineering Building Receives \$5M gift
from Charles and Lisa Simonyi).  This result was not necessarily due by my work
but showed the political conclusions I had were correct. Unfortunately, this
was a private funding, rather than the legislative change in funding I
identified as necessary.

I have not done any further research, but if anybody is interested in
continuing the analysis to see how the UW CoE and in particular its computer
science department has improved (or not improved!) in the intervening years,
please do contact me. My email is now davidollodart@gmail.com.
